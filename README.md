# anti-anxiety-memory-testAbout Dataset

## Context
An experiment on the effects of anti-anxiety medicine on memory recall when being primed with happy or sad memories. The participants were done on novel Islanders whom mimic real-life humans in response to external factors.

Drugs of interest (known-as) [Dosage 1, 2, 3]:

A - Alprazolam (Xanax, Long-term) [1mg/3mg/5mg]

T - Triazolam (Halcion, Short-term) [0.25mg/0.5mg/0.75mg]

S- Sugar Tablet (Placebo) [1 tab/2tabs/3tabs]

*Dosages follow a 1:1 ratio to ensure validity *Happy or Sad memories were primed 10 minutes prior to testing *Participants tested every day for 1 week to mimic addiction

Long term adverse effects on Long Term Potentiation of synapses, metacognition and memory recall ability http://www.jstor.org/stable/43854146

Happy Memories:

research shown positive memories to have a deeper and greater volume of striatum representation under an fMRI https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627314008484

Sad Memories:

research shown sad memories invokes better memory recall for evolutionary purpose whereas, happy memories are more susceptible to false memories http://www.jstor.org/stable/40064315

### Participants
All genders above 25+ years old to ensure a fully developed pre-frontal cortex, a region responsible for higher level cognition and memory recall.

### Content
File contains information on participants drug treatment information along with their test scores.

### Acknowledgements
Experiment was executed under the supervision of Mr. Almohalwas at UCLA. All aspects of the experiment such as experimental design, data collection and preprocessing was done from myself.

### Inspiration
How does anti-anxiety medicine affect you differently by age? Is there a level of plateauing in effectiveness of anti-anxiety medicine - if so, at what point? Effect of anti-anxiety medicine on memory recall? Effectiveness of placebos in a test environment?
